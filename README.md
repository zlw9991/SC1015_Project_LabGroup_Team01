## Problem definition:
Using the percentage change of variables yesterday & the percentage change of Bitcoin's price today, can we create a model that will use the percentage change of variables today to determine if the percentage change of Bitcoin's price tomorrow will be positive or negative?

Some notes:
- the time period will be 24/3/2022 to 14/9/2017.
- we consider zero percentage change to be still positive percentage change as buying with zero percentage change is still not a loss.
- negative change will be represented as 'N', positive or zero change will be represented with 'P'.
