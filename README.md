## Problem definition:
Using the percentage change of variables yesterday & the percentage change of Bitcoin's price today, can we create a model that will use the percentage change of variables today to determine if the percentage change of Bitcoin's price tomorrow will be positive or negative?

Some notes:
- the time period will be 24/3/2022 to 14/9/2017.
- we consider zero percentage change to be still positive percentage change as buying with zero percentage change is still not a loss.
- negative change will be represented as 'N', positive or zero change will be represented with 'P'.

* The Dataset, Data Visualization & Best Random State Script was something we worked on together through trying different sources and methods while improving or correcting each others work. The final result you see here is what we agreed upon was the best to use.
